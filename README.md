# ReactPortfolio

## Hello Welcome to the readMe. page.
The motivation behind this page was to make my own website for future employers to see, a work portfolio.  
## What I learned
Through this project I learned:
* How to use React
* Advanced CSS concepts
* More practice with bootstrap
* That time invested was time well spent and I learned more. The only problem was I was not able to complete the challenge in the amount of time I was given.
  
## Being new to web development I came across some issues you may see obvious such as:
* Grasping the concept of react it took alot of work.
* making an interactive and immersive site in the time we had provided.
